# 0x1 CODE LINES

> Counting lines of code in any language is not as easy as it looks at a first glance. Consider different indentation (whitespaces or tabulators), line or block comments and line breaks specific to given platform. For instance, the following should return 3 lines of code (one for function opening body, second one for the Console method call and the last one for the curly brace closing function's body):
> 
> ```
> /***
> * Example
> //**********//////////////
> 
> public void f() { // Hello there
>     // yikes
> 
>   Console./*TryTo*/Write("Su//p/*");
>}
> ```

Create an utility which counts lines of source code of your favourite language or a generic one. Consider all the mentioned stuff, summaries, stream-based block comments and nested comments. Does your approach work with every single possibility (you don't have to answer, try thinking about it)?

## RULES

1. You can work alone or collaborate in a team.
2. Be honest. Try not to copy-paste other's solutions or chunks of libraries.
3. You are working on your own EXP aka portfolio.
4. You can use any technologies :)

## SOLUTIONS

Assuming you want to be listed here, you need to supply your solution until 06.03.2021 18:00 CET and comply with [regulations](https://github.com/recode-quest/REGULATIONS).
